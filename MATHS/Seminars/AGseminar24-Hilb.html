  <li>29 April 2024, <u>S√∏ren Gammelgaard</u> (SISSA): <em>Projective noncommutative partial resolutions and quiver varieties</em> <br>

  <b>Abstract</b>: We introduce a class of "projective noncommutative schemes" related to the action of a 
    finite SL_2(C)-subgroup G on P^2, building on work by Baranovsky, Ginzburg, and Kuznetsov. 
    We show that despite being noncommutative, these objects enjoy useful properties - for instance, a version 
    of Serre duality - and that they can be interpreted as partial resolutions of the singular (commutative!) 
    scheme P^2/G. We also show that these noncommutative schemes can be used to give interpretations of 
    several Nakajima quiver varieties, generalising earlier results. This is a report on ongoing work with √Åd√°m Gyenge.

    13 May 2024 <u>Paolo Stellari</u> (Universit√† di Milano): 
  <em>Deformations of stability conditions with applications to very general Hilbert schemes of points and abelian varieties</em> <br>

 <b>Abstract</b>: 
    The construction of stability conditions on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on smooth projective varieties is 
    notoriously a difficult problem, especially when the canonical bundle
    is trivial. In this talk, I will illustrate a new and very effective technique based on deformations.<br>
    A key ingredient is a general result about deformations of bounded t-structures (and with some additional and mild assumptions). 
    Two remarkable applications are the construction of stability conditions for very general abelian varieties in any dimension
    and for irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds of Hilb^n-type, again in all possible dimensions. 
    This is joint work with C. Li, E. Macr√¨, Alex Perry and X. Zhao.

    14 May 2024 <u>Felix Thimm</u> (University of Oslo): 
    <em>The 3-fold K-theoretic DT/PT vertex correspondence</em><br>
  <b>Abstract</b>: Donaldson-Thomas (DT) and Pandharipande-Thomas (PT) invariants are two curve counting invariants for 3-folds. 
    In the Calabi-Yau case, a correspondence between the numerical DT and PT invariants has been conjectured by Pandharipande and Thomas 
    and proven by Bridgeland and Toda using wall-crossing. For equivariant K-theoretically refined invariants, the DT/PT correspondence 
    reduces to a DT/PT correspondence of equivariant K-theoretic vertices. In this talk I will explain our proof of the equivariant 
    K-theoretic DT/PT vertex correspondence using a K-theoretic version of Joyce's wall-crossing setup. An important technical tool 
    is the construction of a symmetized pullback of a symmetric perfect obstruction theory on the orginial DT and PT moduli stacks 
    to a symmetric almost perfect obstruction theory on auxiliary moduli stacks. This is joint work with Nick Kuhn and Henry Liu.

  <li>20 May 2024, <u>Shubham Sinha</u> (ICTP): <em>Counting maps from curves to Grassmannians</em> <br>

  <b>Abstract</b>: In this talk, I will construct a virtual fundamental class for the Quot scheme 
    over curves and use it to study the 'virtual' intersection theory of the Quot scheme. 
    I will present the Vafa-Intriligator formula for these intersection numbers and show that 
    they provide an enumerative count of maps from a fixed smooth curve C to Grassmannians, 
    when the degree is large or the genus of C is zero. As an application, I will also derive a 
    ring presentation for the quantum cohomology of Grassmannians.

     28 May 2024, <u>Lars Halle</u> (Universit√† di Bologna): <em>Computing the base change conductor for Jacobians</em> <br>

  <b>Abstract</b>: Let K be a discretely valued field, with ring of integers R. 
     The base change conductor of an abelian K-variety, denoted c(A), is a numerical invariant which 
     measures the failure of A to have semi-abelian reduction over R. It can be difficult in general 
     to compute c(A) explicitly. In this talk I will present an approach for Jacobians, using intersection theory 
     and invariants of quotient singularities on certain normal R-models of the curve in question. 
     Joint work with D. Eriksson and J. Nicaise.
