<h2><p style="color:blue">ICTP/SISSA Research Seminar on Quot schemes &#8211; Fall 2024</p></h2>
<p>

<a href="https://www.ictp.it/member/alina-marian">Alina Marian</a>, <a href="https://users.ictp.it/~ssinha1/">Shubham Sinha</a> and I
organise, since October 2024, a research seminar around the geometry and virtual intersection theory of the Quot scheme of a 
smooth projective surface. We plan to study the irreducibility of the Quot scheme, the existence of a virtual fundamental class 
and the relationship between Quot scheme invariants and the Donaldson type invariants arising from the moduli space of sheaves on the surface.
<a href="">Here</a> is a is a tentative program.

Everyone is very welcome to attend and contribute a talk. For info, please email any of the organisers.

<h3><p style="color:blue">Schedule</p></h3>
We meet every Thursday at 14:30, either at SISSA or at ICTP.
