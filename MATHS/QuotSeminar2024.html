<h2><p style="color:blue">ICTP/SISSA Research Seminar on Quot schemes &#8211; Fall 2024</p></h2>
<p>

<a href="https://users.ictp.it/~gottsche/">Lothar G&ouml;ttsche</a>, 
<a href="https://www.ictp.it/member/alina-marian">Alina Marian</a>, 
<a href="https://users.ictp.it/~ssinha1/">Shubham Sinha</a> and I
organise, since October 2024, a research seminar around the geometry and virtual intersection theory of the Quot scheme of a 
smooth projective surface. We plan to study the irreducibility of the Quot scheme, the existence of a virtual fundamental class 
and the relationship between Quot scheme invariants and the Donaldson type invariants arising from the moduli space of sheaves on the surface.

Everyone is very welcome to attend and contribute a talk. For info, please email any of the organisers.
