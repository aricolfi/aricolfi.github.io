I am associate professor at <a href="https://www.math.sissa.it">SISSA</a>, Trieste, in the group 
    <a href="https://www.math.sissa.it/content/geometry-and-mathematical-physics">Geometry and Mathematical Physics</a>.  
Here is my <a href="MATHS/CV.pdf"><size="5">CV</a>.
    <br> <br>
I work in Algebraic Geometry, mostly on enumerative geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves and their invariants. 
I am also interested in moduli spaces of curves, derived categories of coherent sheaves, 
semiorthogonal decompositions and Fourier&#8211;Mukai transforms. Here are my <a href="MATHS/Coauthors.html">coauthors</a>.
