<h2><p style="color:blue">SISSA Algebraic Geometry Seminar 2022&#8211;2023</p></h2>
<p>

This is the webpage of the SISSA Algebraic Geometry Seminar.
  We meet <font color="red">every Monday at 16:00 in Room 136</font>. Talks are 90 minutes long.
  The tentative topic is <center><u>Derived categories and Bridgeland stability conditions</u>.</center>
  <br>
  We will start with an introduction to triangulated categories and derived functors following 
  D. Huybrechts' book 
  <a href="https://typo.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/fileadmin/groups/arithgeo/templates/data/Judith_Ludwig/Derivierte_Kategorien/H.pdf">
    Fourier&#8211;Mukai transforms in Algebraic Geometry</a>,
  then we will proceed towards Bridgeland stability conditions following (probably a subset of) the following references:

<em>Abstract</em>. The standard Cremona transformation of the projective space is a classical object in algebraic geometry. 
In a joint work with G. Gubbiotti (University of Milan), we studied the algebraic entropy and the invariants of birational 
maps defined as the composition of the standard Cremona transformation with some special projectivities. 
More precisely, we consider projectivities acting on 12 points of the 3-dimensional projective space in Reye configuration. 
These kind of maps appear for instance in the Kahan&#8211;Hirota&#8211;Kimura discretisation of the Euler top.

      Mixed graded structures on Chevalley Eilenberg complexes.<br>
 <em>Abstract</em>. In classical differential geometry, one of the most important algebraic objects associated to the Lie algebra g of a Lie group G is the (cohomological) Chevalley-Eilenberg complex C•(g), which computes the Lie algebra cohomology of g and, under some suitable assumptions, the de Rham cohomology of G as well. In the setting of formal geometry in characteristic 0, the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras can be interpreted in terms of an equivalence of ∞-categories between formal moduli problems and homotopy Lie algebras; in particular, it is natural to expect the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex to be defined for any homotopy Lie algebra, while faithfully retaining the same amount of information as in the classical case. Unfortunately, the standard definition of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for a homotopy Lie algebra is too rough, since it does not even distinguish between non-quasi-isomorphic Lie algebras with same Lie algebra cohomology: instead, one needs to consider the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex as an object in the derived filtered category.
In this talk, we will see how to interpret the datum of the filtration on a chain complex over a ring of characteristic 0 in terms of a mixed graded structure in the sense of Pantev, Toën, Vaquié and Vezzosi, and describe how the Chevalley-Eilenberg functor can be refined to a mixed graded enhancement. The construction is completely ∞-categorical in nature, and does not require the choice of a presentation of homotopy Lie algebras in terms of differential graded Lie algebras or L∞-algebras.
